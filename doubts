what is the difference between efficiency? bandwidth? and throughput?
  bandwidth:- Bandwidth is the raw capability of a communications channel to move data through that channel.
  Typically measured in bits or bytes per second (or some, possibly large, multiple thereof). 
  May also be measured in hertz.
  
Throughout is the number of bits per second. Bandwidth is something directly proportional to throughput.
